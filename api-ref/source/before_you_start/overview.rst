Overview
========

Welcome to the *Simple Message Notification API Reference*. Simple Message Notification (SMN) is a reliable and flexible large-scale message notification service. It enables you to efficiently send messages to phone numbers, email addresses and HTTP/HTTPS servers and connect cloud services through notifications, reducing system complexity.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations in SMN, such as creating, querying, deleting, and updating resources. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <smn_api_20000>`.

Before you use SMN by calling APIs, please get yourself familiar with basic SMN concepts. For details, see "Service Overview" in the *Simple Message Notification User Guide*.
